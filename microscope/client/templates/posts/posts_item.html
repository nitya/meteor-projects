<!-- 3.1 
	Item template expects to see a bound data context that contains
	{url, title, domain} properties

	Because this is invoked from the loop in postList, the data context
	is effectively bound to the specific data item passed down in 
	that specific iteration

	ergo: ensure that 'posts' bound to postsList template has items
	that support the required properties directly
	(note that in this case 'domain' is not defined, hence empty in view)
