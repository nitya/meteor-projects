# Meteor and Leaflets

This is a deconstruction of the [leaflet-parties](https://github.com/awatson1978/leaflet-parties) example that was updated for Meteor 1.0. In particular, the goal here was to break down the steps for the example so we could rebuild and reuse it for other requirements.

Some updates made in the process:
  * Adding Iron-Router support to create a single page app with routes
